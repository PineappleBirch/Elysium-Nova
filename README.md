# Elysium Nova - A Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of end-to-end projects. 

Since I can't showcase proprietary code and workflow from my professional career (NDA), I have decided to make this project. 

It's purpose is mostly to give a glimpse of my experience to anyone whom it may concern as well as for me to have fun!

This repository showcases my skills across multiple disciplines, including:
- Machine Learning Engineering
- Data Processing and Data Engineering
- Manual and Automated Testing (QA)
- Data Analysis and Data Science
- Image Processing and Computer Vision

Each project is self-contained and demonstrates a specific set of technical skills and a professional workflow.

The projects are categorised based on the Discipline and Tier (T1, T2, T3...)

The Tiers roughly correspond to difficulty (subjective) and I plan to add more more projects (and possibly more Tiers) periodically.

For a detailed overview of all planned projects, please see the [**Full Project Roadmap**](./PROJECT_ROADMAP.md).
