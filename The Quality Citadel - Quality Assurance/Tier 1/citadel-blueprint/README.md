# Project: Citadel Blueprint

> A comprehensive manual test suite for the Sauce Demo e-commerce website. This is a Tier 1 project in "The Quality Citadel" series of the Elysium Nova portfolio, focused on demonstrating foundational test design and documentation skills.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase the ability to analyze a web application, identify key features, and design a structured and thorough set of manual test cases. The test suite covers the login, inventory, and checkout functionalities of the Sauce Demo website, including positive ("happy path") and negative test scenarios.

The complete test suite was designed in Notion and then exported to a self-contained HTML file for easy viewing within this repository. The test credentials used (`standard_user`, etc.) are provided publicly on the application's login page.
